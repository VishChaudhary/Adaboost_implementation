# ESE-589-Project-3

Run main.py file as follows:

python main.py 

to see the results for both implementations of Adaboost. 

You can change the following line for other datasets:

file = 'final_datasets/credit_card_binned.csv' // in main.py

Note that all variables in all datasets must be numerical and categorical_label.py can be used to map categories to numerical entries, by simply replacing -1 by the column number you wish to convert to numbers.
